### Markdown

I've been developing applications since high school, doing a few jobs here and there, leaving school I went straight to the Systems Analysis and Development course here in Brazil, I have the dream of working back-end programming and taking my projects forward.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Mauricio-MN/Mauricio-MN.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
