### Opa! BÃ£o?

I'm a junior programmer, I'm 20 years old, I've been developing applications since high school, doing a few jobs here and there, leaving school I went straight to the Systems Analysis and Development course here in Brazil, I have the dream of working back-end programming and taking my projects forward.

### RestaUm (Peg Solitaire)

Made in java, it's not the game itself, but it solves the board quickly using recursion, having as input: Finish with N pieces, Stop with N pieces to finish, be an endgame centered on the union.
Output: Number of pieces captured, moves made to reach the objective, number of matches and number of moves.
